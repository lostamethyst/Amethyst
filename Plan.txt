To be added...


Prismatic diamond - combines all gems into one rare super gemstone. Used for higher tier items. (inspired by bob20bob3)

Crystal drill - similar to airblast, same size but requires more power. Requires cryofluid to cool, but high mining speed

Supercharged gems - require power to "supercharge" into rarer items for higher tier items such as Laser Turrets or upgraded batteries


maybe...

upgraded water extractor?


If possible (not sure if these will work or not):

Upgraded unloader, phase conveyor, bridges
